# Python Username Validator üîí

### *A Simple Script for Enforcing Username Rules*

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a straightforward Python script designed to validate user-inputted usernames based on a set of common rules. It's a great example of using fundamental programming concepts like **conditional logic**, **string manipulation**, and **user input handling** to create a practical validation system.

I developed this project as a learning exercise to solidify my understanding of Python's string methods and `if-elif-else` statements. It's a foundational piece that helps demonstrate how to set basic data entry rules in applications.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Minimum Length Check:** Ensures usernames meet a specified character count.
* **No Spaces Rule:** Prevents usernames from containing any whitespace.
* **Alphabetical Characters Only:** Restricts usernames to only letters (a-z, A-Z).
* **Clear Feedback:** Provides specific error messages for each rule violation.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

To run this script on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or copy the code into a `.py` file):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/7asan-mrisat/Python-Username-Validator
    cd username-rules.py
    ```

2.  **Execute the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python username_validator.py
    ```
    (Assuming you save the code as `username_validator.py`)

3.  **Follow the prompts** in your terminal!

## üß† What I Learned

Working on this project helped me gain a stronger grasp of:

* **`if`, `elif`, and `else` Statements:** Mastering the order and logic of branching conditions.
* **String Methods:** Effectively using built-in Python functions like `len()`, the `in` operator for substring checks, and `isalpha()`.
* **User Interaction:** Taking input from the command line (`input()`) and providing clear output (`print()`).
* **Basic Validation Logic:** Understanding how to define and implement rules for user-submitted data.
* **Code Clarity:** Writing code that is easy to read and understand.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Ideas for Growth)

* **Add more validation rules:**
    * Check for minimum number of digits or special characters.
    * Prevent specific reserved words.
* **Loop for re-entry:** Allow the user to try entering a username again after an invalid attempt, instead of exiting.
* **Provide all errors at once:** Instead of stopping at the first error, collect all validation issues and report them together.
* **Implement a scoring system:** Give a "strength" score to the username.
